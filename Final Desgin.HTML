                   <h2>How does the well-being of students affect their performance in examinations?</h2>
            <img src="Student Well Being.jpg" alt="Student Well Being" />
            <p>Under periods of extreme stress, psychological studies have proven that performance dips below optimum level. A study conducted in British International Schools by ISC Research highlighted that 83% of teachers feel that exam stress can impact negatively on student outcomes in their exams. Not only is this indicative that students perhaps don’t always fulfill their full potential with the exam style assessment, but it also runs the risk of being detrimental to their health and wellbeing. This suggests that more evenly spreading exam times across the term or perhaps even having students sit fewer exams could be a way to implement a whole school approach to wellbeing.</p>

		<h3>What can students do to relive stress?</h3>
		<img src="Tips for Anxiety.jpg" alt="Student Well Being" />
		<p> Managing stress is essential for students, and there are several effective strategies to find relief. Regular exercise, even a short walk or engaging in sports, can significantly reduce anxiety and improve mood. Mindfulness practices like meditation and yoga help calm the mind and enhance focus. Establishing a daily routine fosters stability, while using planners or to-do lists can alleviate feelings of being overwhelmed.

Social connections are crucial; talking to friends or family provides emotional support and new perspectives. Monitoring diet is important too—reducing caffeine and sugar can stabilize mood and energy levels. Taking regular breaks during study sessions prevents burnout and maintains concentration. Engaging in hobbies, such as painting or music, offers a creative outlet for stress relief. Lastly, ensuring adequate sleep is vital for mental health. If stress becomes overwhelming, seeking help from counseling services can provide valuable support. By incorporating these techniques, students can improve their overall well-being.</p>
